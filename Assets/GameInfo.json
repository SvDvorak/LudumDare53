They scowled at her as she gobbled down their meager provisions, muttering about the \"overindulgent outsider\". Lavender's embarrassment turned to horror as she realized she had eaten the last of their food supply. She offered to make amends, but it was too late. The angry mob of locals chased her out of the sanctuary and into the wilderness, where Lavender was forced to fend for herself, regretting her gluttony all the while. The group had no choice but to continue on without her."

			"Success": "You have successfully entered the cave.",
			"Failure": "As Lavender led the group into the bustling streets of the Borough, she felt her energy levels beginning to wane. Try as she might, she couldn't keep up with the frenzied pace of the city, and her usual vivacity was replaced with lethargy. She found herself slumping against buildings and resting on benches, much to the chagrin of the bustling inhabitants who jostled past her. Her love of fine foods and relaxation had caught up with her, and the constant motion of the Borough proved too much for her slothful ways. Despite the group's efforts to motivate her, Lavender simply couldn't muster the energy to continue on, and she bid them a tired farewell as she settled into a cozy café to indulge in some pastries and a well-deserved nap."

The tools used in the process include specialized blending machines, filtration systems, and heating equipment, as well as laboratory equipment to test the final product for quality and consistency.
